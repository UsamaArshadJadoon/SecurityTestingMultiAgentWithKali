# Agent-032A-Advanced: Advanced

## Overview
Comprehensive penetration testing for Advanced

## Tools Integrated
- Security testing tools integrated

## Testing Approach

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment
- Target scope verification
- Asset inventory collection
- Configuration analysis
- Technology identification
- Security baseline establishment

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Identification
- Systematic vulnerability scanning
- Manual testing procedures
- Configuration review
- Policy violation detection
- Evidence collection

### Phase 3: Exploitation & Validation
- Proof-of-concept development
- Impact assessment
- Real evidence collection
- Reproducibility verification
- Multi-step exploitation chains

### Phase 4: Documentation
- Detailed finding documentation
- CVSS 3.1 scoring
- OWASP/CWE/MITRE mapping
- Remediation guidance
- Developer-actionable recommendations

## Validation Requirements
✓ Authentic vulnerability reproduction
✓ Real evidence from target system
✓ Reproducible exploitation steps
✓ Complete technical documentation
✓ Verified impact assessment
✓ Proper data organization for downstream agents

## CVSS Scoring
- Uses CVSS 3.1 vector scoring
- Attack Vector: Network/Adjacent Network/Local/Physical
- Attack Complexity: Low/High
- Privileges Required: None/Low/High
- User Interaction: None/Required
- Scope: Unchanged/Changed
- CIA Impacts: High/Low/None

## Evidence Collection
- Actual HTTP requests and responses
- Command execution proof
- System screenshots
- Tool output (nmap, burpsuite, etc.)
- Configuration file excerpts
- Database dumps (if applicable)

## Remediation Guidance
- Specific fix recommendations
- Code examples for developers
- Configuration changes needed
- Best practices to implement
- Estimated effort to fix
- Compliance considerations

## Success Criteria
✓ Vulnerability authentically reproduced
✓ Real evidence collected from target system
✓ Complete exploitation path documented
✓ Technical details sufficiently detailed for developer understanding
✓ Impact clearly demonstrated
✓ Remediation is actionable and verifiable

## Dependency Flow
**Input:** Target scope, previous agent findings
**Output:** Validated findings with evidence
**Feeds:** Downstream agents and final penetration test report
